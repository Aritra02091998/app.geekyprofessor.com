        <h3>What is JPEG Image Extensions ?</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
          JPEG is an abbreviation for "Joint Photographic Experts Group," which is also the name of the body that developed it.<br>

          JPEG is the most widely used digital camera format. Furthermore, the majority of photographs we view on the internet today are JPEGs.<br>

          JPEGs are divided into two types: Exif (for digital cameras) and JFIF (for storing and transferring).
        </p>

        <p>
          JPEG files are among the most ubiquitous and commonly used image formats. JPEG files, which use lossy compression, assist reduce the overall size of your image files without affecting image quality. JPEG is the ideal file type to use when publishing photos to the web or sharing photos with others.

        <h3>Difference Between JPG and JPEG Images ?</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
          JPEG and JPG are both file types that stand for "Joint Photographic Experts Group." JPG is a file extension that originated on early Windows machines that only allowed for a three-letter extension name. Although the JPEG file extension is more typically found on current computers, some individuals still refer to these files as JPG.
