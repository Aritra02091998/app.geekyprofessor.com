        <h2>What is a SIP ?</h2>

        <p>
          Potential buyers may mistakenly believe that SIPs and mutual funds are the same thing. SIPs, on the other hand, are simply one technique of investing in mutual funds, the other being a lump payment. A SIP calculator is a tool that assists you in determining the returns you can obtain when investing in such tools. SIP, or Systematic Investment Plan, is a method of investing a certain amount of money in mutual funds at regular periods. SIPs often allow you to invest on a weekly, quarterly, or monthly basis.

        <h2>How a SIP Works ?</h2>

        <p>
          SIP is a method of investing a set amount in a mutual fund at regular periods. SIP investing allows you to buy units of a mutual fund for a certain sum on a set date each month. SIP investing is a method of investing that does not require you to invest manually each time. To automate your investments, you must submit a SIP bank mandate.

        <h2>How SIP is calculated  ?</h2>

        <p>
          As discussed SIP is calculated using the below formula both manually and automatically online.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            FV = P [(1+i)^n-1]*(1+i)/i ,  where

        <h2>What are type of SIP in mutual funds ?</h2>

        <br>
        
        <strong>1. Top Up SIP</strong>

        <p>
          You can modify the quantity of SIP insealment by a fixed amount at pre-defined periods with a top-up SIP. For example, if you have been putting Rs. 1,000 in an equities fund every month, you can use the top up option to boost your contribution to Rs. 1,500. This is a simple approach to donate more to your goals as your income grows over time.
        </p>

        <strong>2. Flexible SIP</strong>

        <p>
          Until now, you've learned that SIP stands for systematic investment in a mutual fund. But what if you can't afford to invest the same amount every month? In this case, you should consider investing through a flexible SIP. You can adjust your monthly investments based on your financial flow. In the event of a financial emergency, you can reduce the SIP amount. And if you have a lot of cash flow, you can invest a lot more. This is a viable alternative for entrepreneurs who do not earn a regular monthly salary.        
        </p>

        <strong>3. Perpetual SIP</strong>

        <p>
          Investors often choose to invest in a mutual fund for a set period of time. This can be for a period of six months, three years, five years, or 10 years. But what if you don't want to tie your SIP contribution to a specific date? When you select the permanent option, this is conceivable. You can continue investing in the fund through SIP for as long as you want unless you give the AMC specific instructions to stop. When you have amassed a sufficient corpus to meet your financial objectives, you can redeem the sum.

        <h2>How to Calculate CAGR for SIP for mutual fund ?</h2>

        <p>
          Cash inflows and outflows from SIPs may not be equal and may be irregular at times. As a result, it is best to use XIRR to compute SIP returns. Because CAGR computes point-to-point returns, it is ineffective for estimating SIP returns. CAGR, on the other hand, can be used to calculate returns on lump-sum investments. XIRR is a function in Excel (or any other spreadsheet tool) that will assist you in calculating annualised returns for your SIP tenure.
