        <h3 id="seoHeader">Why is image compression important ?</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
          1. A compressed image is smaller in size. As a result, your memory card can carry either 10 raw (uncompressed) photographs or 100 compressed images (numbers out of air here). You get more for your money when you buy a memory card.
        </p>

        <p>  
          2. When viewing a picture from the Internet on a mobile phone, you may need to wait 5 seconds for a raw image or 1 second for a compressed image. This improves the user experience while also lowering the cost of your data plan.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Another reason why you might need to compress images is while filling up a registration form of any Organisation or University who have a certain restriction on the size of image that can be uploaded. In this case also you need to compress image online to be able to submit the form successfully.

        <h3 id="seoHeader">What is JPEG Image Extensions ?</h3>

        <br>

        <p>
          JPEG is an abbreviation for "Joint Photographic Experts Group," which is also the name of the body that developed it.<br>

          JPEG is the most widely used digital camera format. Furthermore, the majority of photographs we view on the internet today are JPEGs.<br>

          JPEGs are divided into two types: Exif (for digital cameras) and JFIF (for storing and transferring).
        </p>

        <p>
          JPEG files are among the most ubiquitous and commonly used image formats. JPEG files, which use lossy compression, assist reduce the overall size of your image files without affecting image quality. JPEG is the ideal file type to use when publishing photos to the web or sharing photos with others.
