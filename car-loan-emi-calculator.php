          For example, if you borrow Rs.10,00,000 from the bank at 6.5% annual interest for a period of 5 years then Monthly EMI = 10,00,000 * 0.00541 * (1 + 0.00541)60 / ((1 + 0.00541)60 - 1) = Rs.1957. i.e. you will have to pay Rs.1957 for 60 months to repay the entire loan amount. The total amount payable will be Rs.1,17,397 that includes Rs.17,397 as interest toward the loan.

        <h2>What is an Car loan EMI ?</h2>

        <p>
          The Equated Monthly Instalment (or EMI) is made up of the principal and interest part of the loan. As a result, the EMI equals the principal amount plus the interest paid on the Car Loan. The EMI is often fixed for the whole term of your loan and is to be returned monthly over the term of the loan.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the amount of principal and interest components in your monthly EMI payment won't alter, it will over time. You'll put more money toward the principal and less toward interest with each additional payment.

        <h2>Consider Floating Rate EMI In Car EMI Calculation </h2>

        <p>
          We advise you to compute the floating or variable rate EMI by taking into account two opposing situations, namely the optimistic (deflationary) and pessimistic (inflationary) scenarios. You are going to choose how much money you need to borrow and how long your loan term should be. Loan amount and loan tenure are two factors needed to compute the EMI. However, banks and HFCs choose interest rates based on the rates and guidelines set by the RBI. You should compute your EMI as a borrower taking into account the two extreme scenarios of an increase and a drop in the interest rate.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Optimistic( Deflationary ) Case:</strong>
          Assume that the interest rate decreases from its current level by 1% to 3%. Calculate your EMI taking this circumstance into account. Your EMI will decrease in this case, or you might choose to reduce the loan's term. For instance, a positive situation allows you to compare buying a house as an investment with other investment alternatives.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Pessimistic( Inflationary ) Case:</strong>
          Assume that the interest rate is increased by 1% to 3% in a similar manner. Do you think you'll be able to keep making EMI payments without too much difficulty? Your monthly payment for the duration of the loan could significantly increase with even a 2% increase in the interest rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your planning and instant online Car EMI calculation for such potential future events is aided by such a computation. When you take out a loan, you're committing to a certain amount of money for the upcoming months, years, or decades. Think on the best and worst case scenarios, and prepare for both. In other words, expect the best while preparing for the worse!

        <h2>How is the Car Loan EMI to be paid ?</h2>

        <p>
          You can select either of these:
        </p>

        <p>
          Standing Instructions (SI) can be used if you have an Axis Bank savings, salary, or current account. Your EMI will be deducted immediately from the account you designate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not have an Axis Bank account and would like your EMIs to be debited automatically at the conclusion of the monthly cycle, you can use a National Automated Clearing House (NACH)/ECS mandate.        
        </p>
        <p>
          Post-Dated Cheques for Your Automobile Loan If you do not have an Bank account and live in a non-ECS region, you can pay in instalments.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h2>What happens if you skip your EMI ?</h2>

        <p>
          Remember that missing EMIs reflects poorly on your creditworthiness and may have an influence on your credit score. As a result, borrow prudently in the interest of your financial well-being and, as much as possible, do not skip your payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you miss an EMI due to inadequate funds or for any other reason, the bank will notify you and may levy a late payment penalty. The loan's duration would lengthen as a result of missing the EMI (assuming EMIs remaining the same).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that frequent late payments increase the possibility of default, and in such a case, your car, which was hypothecated to the bank as collateral for the Car Loan, may be seized. As a result, always make it a point to pay your Car Loan EMI on time.
