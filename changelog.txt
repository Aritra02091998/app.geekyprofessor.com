imagepng() = method to save a pngpicture was not working and was gnrting error.
bcz out of three param of imagepng(sourceFile, Save Destination , quality )
the quality can have the max value 9 for png images.
It was fixed now and currently quality set to 6.

Larger img files was not getting compressed and showing compression failed was causing
bcz in php.ini configuration file of apache2 server localhost the 
"upload_max_size" parameter was set to 2MB only.

this parameter now changed to set 20MB value.
Larger files are getting compressed now.

the same needs to be done when uploaded on webhost.

the error was:

Notice: Undefined index: image in /var/www/html/image2/handlers/handleConvertJPGPNGtoWebP.php on line 46

Notice: Trying to access array offset on value of type null in /var/www/html/image2/handlers/handleConvertJPGPNGtoWebP.php on line 46

But it has nothing to do with any index or arrays, simply the file is not uploading.So, while accessing the $_FILES['image']['name'] php found null value so gnrtd the error.
