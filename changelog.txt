imagepng() = method to save a pngpicture was not working and was gnrting error.
bcz out of three param of imagepng(sourceFile, Save Destination , quality )
the quality can have the max value 9 for png images.
It was fixed now and currently quality set to 6.

Larger img files was not getting compressed and showing compression failed was causing
bcz in php.ini configuration file of apache2 server localhost the 
"upload_max_size" parameter was set to 2MB only.

this parameter now changed to set 20MB value.
Larger files are getting compressed now.

the same needs to be done when uploaded on webhost.

the error was:

Notice: Undefined index: image in /var/www/html/image2/handlers/handleConvertJPGPNGtoWebP.php on line 46

Notice: Trying to access array offset on value of type null in /var/www/html/image2/handlers/handleConvertJPGPNGtoWebP.php on line 46

But it has nothing to do with any index or arrays, simply the file is not uploading.So, while accessing the $_FILES['image']['name'] php found null value so gnrtd the error.

Dependency: Imagick library php

PDF to JPG converted feature finished.

This feature takes a pdf files counts the number of pages and generate jpg file for each pages then combines them into zip file and sends to the user (downloads automatically when progress bar reaches 100).

Implemented through php Header.

whenevr convertPDFtoJPG file submits the form of pdf file to handleConvertPDFtoJPG.php file, the script does all the conversion under the hood and sends it to the header and cleans up the converted files by itself.

So when the handleConvertPDFtoJPG file tries to load the converted zip file downloaded automatically(implemented through a hidden btn which is clicked by JS).

Autmatic file deletion implemented.
